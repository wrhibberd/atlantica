			The inaugural UNILAG-Exeter <i>Atlantica</i> symposium, <strong
				><i>Seen from Lagos</i></strong
			> is oriented towards the future in its exploration of solutions and
			routes through barriers which we find in the contemporary academy. It
			begins with the fear identified by Muyiwa Falaiye in his 2017 essay “Is
			African Studies Afraid of African Philosophy?” If even specialised branches
			of Area Studies devoted to the study of Africa are either ignorant of,
			or uneasy in dealing with, theories, concepts and methods drawn from
			African knowledge systems, what hope is there for the broader fields
			of the Humanities and the Social Sciences?
		</p>
		<p>
			While the subsequent years since the publication of Falaiye’s
			article have vibrantly trailed the rise of a “decolonial turn,”
			particularly in institutions in the Global North, there is scant
			evidence that academic disciplines have shown any appetite to find
			new ways to think from or with modes of thought from the Global
			South. Equally noteworthy is the inadequacy of mutually conceived
			intentional conversations bridging knowledge spaces of the Global
			South. Though unacknowledged, this is partly a function of the
			difficulties entailed in both unlearning existing modes of
			perceiving the world, and navigating through various entanglements
			of subjectivities, alongside the hard graft needed in opening one’s
			mind to understanding through other languages, concepts and modes of
			being.
		</p>
		<p>
			This <i>Atlantica</i> platform directly addresses such deficits through
			the provision of case studies which it hopes will inspire others to see
			the expected awakening which can arrive through approaches to knowledge
			creation which find inspiration in specific schools of thinking or praxis
			from the African continent. As such, it showcases philosophical studies
			which are able to engage prevalent pedagogies, explore and situate the
			value of indigenous epistemologies; not necessarily divorcing them from
			broader currents within their academic fields, though naming and enumerating
			their specific utility.
		</p>
		<p>
			A second originating position lies in the study of art, both through
			forms of cultural practice and in the discipline of the history of
			art as it has been reconstrued by African – and especially Nigerian
			– writers such as Chika Okeke-Agulu and Rowland Ọlá Abíọ́dún.
			Beginning with this latter thinker, we take seriously his admonition
			that we are faced with the “urgent task” not simply of documenting
			global differences but ensuring “the survival and essential role of
			African artistic and aesthetic concepts in the study of art in
			Africa.” For this to happen, Abíọ́dún proposes a progressive
			abandonment of the conventional methods of the Western humanities,
			for their tendency is one of “concealing and even eliminating the
			social and religio-aesthetic foundation of the visual arts.”
		</p>
		<p>
			Looking beyond Africa towards other exemplars, we are able to see
			the manner in which fundamental notions of time, history and
			aesthetics have been upended in quite general, as well as scholarly,
			fashions in locales such as Australia, where indigenous modes of
			artistic production have induced paradigmatic changes in thought.
			Similar tendencies can also be seen in specialised fields of study
			in Islamic art, in which the specificity of forms of Muslim
			spiritual enlightenment are prized above the emplacement of works of
			art within Western frames of knowledge.
		</p>
		<p>
			Returning to Nigeria, it is arguable that one of the greatest
			conceptual gains which has emerged through the creation of
			indigenous forms of modernism by groups such as the Nsukka School
			has been their imagination of cultural production as a marriage of
			forms. Far from precluding deeper understandings of indigenous
			knowledge, fine art presents opportunities to disseminate such
			understandings in new fashions, to both local and international
			audiences. Relatedly, the degree to which an easy interchange across
			the study and making of art – evinced at UNILAG in the work of Peju
			Layiwola and others – reflects a positive belief in the ideal of
			conceptual and embodied forms of knowledge-making working in tandem.

		<p>
			<i>Seen from Lagos</i> is the first in a new series of <i
				>Atlantica</i
			> platforms and events, building towards a pan-Atlantic biennial of contemporary
			art and critical enquiry. Working with artists, writers and communities,
			<i>Atlantica</i> aims to re-examine the multiple histories and ‘historical
			presents’ of the Atlantic from diverse contemporary perspectives, challenging
			the supposedly ‘universal’ knowledge system that has inherently privileged
			a Eurocentric worldview.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Seen from Lagos</i> is co-convened by Prof Muyiwa Falaiye, Institute
			of African and Diaspora Studies, and Prof Peju Layiwola, Art History,
			at University of Lagos, together with Prof William Gallois, Institute
			of Arab and Islamic Studies, and Prof Tom Trevor, Art History and Visual
			Culture, at University of Exeter. The programme has been coordinated
			with the support of Prof Ayodele Yusuff and Ms. Bolatito Kolawole. The
			<i>Atlantica</i> series is convened by Prof Tom Trevor.
